- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am a Brazilian who has a beautiful relationship with feedback, it was the tool I used to develop my English skills, and if it helped me with that I believe it will continue to serve me well in the tech industry!
- When I'm not coding, I enjoy staying active through workouts, gaming, exploring the beauty of the British countryside, or simply observing birds in nature.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me on, LinkedIn Facebook, Instagram and obviously here.
